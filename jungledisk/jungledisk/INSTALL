Jungle Disk for Linux
---------------------
Jungle Disk for Linux allows you to mount your online storage directly on
the local file system and access your files using any application. It also
includes an automatic backup feature for securing your data offsite.

Two versions of Jungle Disk for Linux are included:

1. The GTK2-GUI binary is called "junglediskmonitor", or "junglediskworkgroup", 
depending on your version of Jungle Disk (hereafter, "junglediskmonitor" 
will be used to refer to both binaries). The Jungle Disk Monitor provides a 
complete UI for configuration and status monitoring. It also supports automatic 
backup, and can mount your online disks as virtual drives via FUSE.

2. The CLI version is called "jungledisk". This command-line-only daemon was
designed for headless servers and/or for use in fstab and cron jobs. "jungledisk" 
supports file system mounting via FUSE, as well as automatic backup. Note that
the CLI version has no user interface for creating the Jungle Disk settings file,
so you may wish to use Jungle Disk Monitor to setup your online disks and backups, 
then make a copy of the settings file for use with the CLI/daemon.

Installation
------------
Mounting your Jungle Disk directly via the file system requires
that you have the FUSE filesystem installed. You can install it
from packages for your distribution or from source via:

http://fuse.sourceforge.net/

On Ubuntu you would run: apt-get install fuse-utils

"junglediskmonitor" can be run from any directory, so you can
leave it in your user directory or copy it to a directory in
the path (e.g. /usr/bin)

"jungledisk" can also be run from any directory. However, if you
want to mount your disk from fstab, it MUST be located somewhere
in the path (e.g. /usr/bin)

Configuration
-------------
"junglediskmonitor" has a built-in configuration interface which will be
shown the first time you run the application. After configuring, your
settings will be saved under the "~/.jungledisk" directory.

"jungledisk" does not provide a configuration interface and must be provided
with a valid configuration file. We do not recommend creating your
configuration by hand. Instead, use junglediskmonitor on another machine
with a GUI, and copy the config file to your server. 

If you do not have a Linux Desktop machine available, you can use the "USB"
version of the Mac or Windows Jungle Disk Client to create a configuration
file to use on your server. You cannot use a configuration file from the
non-USB versions on Mac or Windows, as they encrypt their settings in a way
that is not readable on Linux.

The configuration file can be placed in ~/.jungledisk, or in /etc or another
path, and you can specify the path to the file on the command line.
The WebDAV interface to Jungle Disk is optional with the command line version.
You can disable it by setting the ListenPort to 0 in the configuration.

Running
-------
"junglediskmonitor" does not require any command line options to run (just
double-click the file on your desktop)

"jungledisk" does not require any command line options, but you can specify 
the mount point and FUSE mount options on the command line if desired.

If multiple online disks are configured in the configuration file, the mountpoint
specified on the command line will override the mountpoint in the configuration
file. For example:

/usr/bin/jungledisk /mnt/jungledisk
/usr/bin/jungledisk /mnt/s3 --config /etc/jungledisk-settings.xml

If you get an error on startup or the application is not running, you
may be missing a required library or the FUSE module may not be loaded.
Run "ldd junglediskmonitor" from the a terminal to see if any libraries
are missing.

To load the FUSE module, run "modprobe fuse" as root. Instructions for
loading the FUSE module at boot are included below in the fstab section.

Running as non-root
-------------------
Both "jungledisk" and "junglediskmonitor" can be run by non-root users,
however if you want to allow FUSE filesystem mounting you must grant
appropriate permissions to:

/dev/fuse (the fuse device driver)
/usr/bin/fusermount (the fuse mount helper application)

..as well as the actual mount point

On some distributions you simply need to add the user to the "fuse"
group. Otherwise you may need to run:
chmod o+rw /dev/fuse
chmod o+rw /usr/bin/fusermount

If the /dev/fuse device does not exist, try "modprobe fuse". If the module 
is not found, you do not have the FUSE filesystem installed.

Using "junglediskmonitor"
-------------------------
If you have configured automatic mounting, your Jungle Disk will be mounted
at the specified directory (default: ~/jungledisk). You can pass additional 
FUSE parameters after the mount point in the configuration. For example:

"/mnt/jungledisk -o allow_other"

Note that if you are not a root user, you must have permission to use the 
FUSE filesystem to mount your Jungle Disk (see above).

Although less reliable than FUSE, you can also access the disk via any WebDAV 
client:

-- To connect to your Jungle Disk in KDE, just open a Konquerer window and type
"webdav://localhost:2667/".  In GNOME, select "Connect to Server" under the
Places menu. 
-- Set the Service type to WebDAV (HTTP). 
-- Enter "localhost" in the server and "2667" for the port. 

Using "jungledisk"
------------------
To see a list of command-line options, type "jungledisk -h". If configured 
correctly, your Jungle Disk will be mounted at the specified mount point. 

To reload the configuration, run "killall -HUP jungledisk"

To exit the application gracefully, run "killall -QUIT jungledisk". You can 
also force an exit by unmounting the filesystem with umount. Note that if you
unmount the filesystem with open file handles you will receive an error when
trying to close the files. Also, you cannot re-mount the filesystem until all 
handles are closed (this includes shells with a working directory inside the 
mounted file system)

If you have the WebDAV server enabled, you can view any background operations
by loading: http://localhost:2667/~operations via a web browser or curl.

Running from fstab
------------------
You can mount your filesystem via the fstab file by adding a line such as the
one below (note how the path to the config file is specified as part of the 
FUSE options.)

jungledisk  /mnt/jungle  fuse  noauto,config=/path/to/jungledisk-settings.xml 0 0

You can then mount your filesystem with "mount /mnt/jungle", or place this command
somewhere in your boot process to mount the filesystem at boot time (after the
network comes up).

Note that jungledisk will mount all of your online disks that have been configured 
with mount points. The first mount point will be set to the one specified in fstab, 
but the remaining network drives will be mounted as found in your settings
file.

Jungledisk MUST be in your path to mount via fstab.

Also, you must ensure that the FUSE module is loaded on boot. This varies
by distribution. Some common ones:

Debian / Ubuntu:
echo "fuse" >> /etc/modules

Gentoo:
echo "fuse" >> /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6

Fedora:
echo "/sbin/modprobe fuse" >> /etc/rc.local

Suse:
Edit /etc/sysconfig/kernel and add "fuse" to the MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT

Access by other users
---------------------
By default the mounted path will only be available to the user who mounted it.

If you want to allow root or other users to access the mount you need to use
the FUSE options "-o allow_root" or "-o allow_other". You may also need to set
the umask, as in "-o umask=007".

These parameters can be specified in fstab or on the command line:

(fstab)   jungledisk /mnt/mountpoint fuse defaults,noauto,user,config=/path/to/jungledisk-settings.xml,allow_other,umask=007 0 0
(command) /mnt/mountpoint -o rw,umask=007,allow_other,default_permissions

Alternatively, you can configure FUSE options in the configuration file after the 
mountpoint path (similar to the way it is done on the command line). This approach
is particularly useful when mounting multiple disks, since only the first disk will
pick up the extra FUSE options specified on the command line or in fstab.

Note: To allow the options to work for non-root users, be sure to add the option
"user_allow_other" to your /etc/fuse.conf file.

Using rsync with Jungle Disk
----------------------------
Once running and mounted on the local file system, you can use rsync to easily
copy files to and from your S3 storage. Most rsync options should work fine,
however for best performance we recommend using the --inplace option which
avoids extra renames. 

You should also use the --times (-t) option so that modification times are 
replicated and used to detect changes. If you prefer not to replicate 
modification times, you may want to use --checksum (-c) or --size-only to 
prevent files from being re-copied on every run.

Jungle Disk can preserve symlinks, devices, group/owner/permissions, and
modification/creation times if those options are specified. Currently, 
hard-links are not supported.

Sample command lines:
# copy all files and attributes (times/permissions/owners/links/etc)
rsync -a --inplace /src/* /mnt/jungle

# copy only normal files and preserve modification times
rsync -t -r --inplace /src/* /mnt/jungle

# copy only file data and use size to determine changes
rsync -r --size-only --inplace /src/* /mnt/jungle

Troubleshooting
---------------
"junglediskmonitor" logs all errors to the GUI. You can double-click an
error for more details or right-click to copy to the clipboard.

"jungledisk" logs all errors to /var/log/jungledisk.log when running
as root, and ~/.jungledisk/jungledisk.log when running as non-root.
Make sure you check the log file if your disk does not mount properly.

If you encounter an error that you are unable to resolve, please visit our
support site (support.jungledisk.com) where you can view the user manual,
search our knowledge base and forums, or submit a support ticket.

Jungle Disk includes several optimizations to improve performance by 
delaying network activity until needed. In most cases this is transparent
to applications.

By default, Jungle Disk also assumes that when an application opens a file
using the O_WRONLY mode it intends to write the entire file, so the previous
file contents are not downloaded. This assumption holds true for many, but
not all applications. 

Note: You can disable these optimizations by passing "-s" on the jungledisk
command line (currently only in the command line version).
